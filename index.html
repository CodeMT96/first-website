    <h1>Deep Sea</h1>

    <div class="toptext">
      <section class="pad-action">
        <p>
          The deep sea is broadly defined as the ocean depth where light begins
          to fade, at an approximate depth of 200 metres (656 feet) or the point
          of transition from continental shelves to continental slopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditions within the deep sea are a combination of low temperatures,
          darkness and high pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deep sea is considered the least explored Earth biome, with the
          extreme conditions making the environment difficult to access and
          explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organisms living within the deep sea have a variety of adaptations to
          survive in these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organisms can survive in the deep sea through a number of feeding
          methods including scavenging, predation and filtration, with a number
          of organisms surviving by feeding on marine snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marine snow is organic material that has fallen from upper waters into
          the deep sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1960, the bathyscaphe Trieste descended to the bottom of the
          Mariana Trench near Guam, at 10,911 m (35,797 ft; 6.780 mi), the
          deepest known spot in any ocean. If Mount Everest (8,848 m or 29,029
          ft or 5.498 mi) were submerged there, its peak would be more than 2 km
          (1.2 mi) beneath the surface
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Trieste was retired, the Japanese remote-operated vehicle
          (ROV) Kaikō was the only vessel capable of reaching this depth until
          it was lost at sea in 2003. In May and June 2009, the hybrid-ROV
          Nereus returned to the Challenger Deep for a series of three dives to
          depths exceeding 10,900 m (35,800 ft; 6.8 mi)

      <h2>Environmental characteristics</h2>
      <h3>Light</h3>
      <p>
        Natural light does not penetrate the deep ocean, with the exception of
        the upper parts of the mesopelagic. Since photosynthesis is not
        possible, plants and phytoplankton cannot live in this zone, and as
        these are the primary producers of almost all of earth's ecosystems,
        life in this area of the ocean must depend on energy sources from
        elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Except for the areas close to the hydrothermal vents, this energy comes
        from organic material drifting down from the photic zone. The sinking
        organic material is composed of algal particulates, detritus, and other
        forms of biological waste, which is collectively referred to as marine
        snow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="pad-action">
      <h3>Pressure</h3>
      <p>
        Because pressure in the ocean increases by about 1 atmosphere for every
        10 meters of depth, the amount of pressure experienced by many marine
        organisms is extreme. Until recent years, the scientific community
        lacked detailed information about the effects of pressure on most deep
        sea organisms because the specimens encountered arrived at the surface
        dead or dying and weren't observable at the pressures at which they
        lived.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        With the advent of traps that incorporate a special pressure-maintaining
        chamber, undamaged larger metazoan animals have been retrieved from the
        deep sea in good condition.
      </p>

    <section class="pad-action">
      <h3>Salinity</h3>
      <p>
        Salinity is remarkably constant throughout the deep sea, at about 35
        parts per thousand.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        There are some minor differences in salinity, but none that are
        ecologically significant, except in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="pad-action">
      <h3>Temperature</h3>
      <p>
        The two areas of greatest temperature gradient in the oceans are the
        transition zone between the surface waters and the deep waters, the
        thermocline, and the transition between the deep-sea floor and the hot
        water flows at the hydrothermal vents. Thermoclines vary in thickness
        from a few hundred meters to nearly a thousand meters. Below the
        thermocline, the water mass of the deep ocean is cold and far more
        homogeneous. Thermoclines are strongest in the tropics, where the
        temperature of the epipelagic zone is usually above 20 °C. From the base
        of the epipelagic, the temperature drops over several hundred meters to
        5 or 6 °C at 1,000 meters. It continues to decrease to the bottom, but
        the rate is much slower. The cold water stems from sinking heavy surface
        water in the polar regions.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        At any given depth, the temperature is practically unvarying over long
        periods of time, without seasonal changes and with very little
        interannual variability. No other habitat on earth has such a constant
        temperature.In hydrothermal vents the temperature of the water as it
        emerges from the "black smoker" chimneys may be as high as 400 °C (it is
        kept from boiling by the high hydrostatic pressure) while within a few
        meters it may be back down to 2 to 4 °C.
